# ðŸŸ¨ JavaScript Execution Context & Event Loop â€“ Complete Guide

---

## 1. What is Execution Context?

Execution Context = **the environment where JS code runs**.

Every time JavaScript executes code, it creates an **Execution Context (EC)** that keeps track of:

* **Variable Environment** â†’ variables, functions.
* **Scope Chain** â†’ access to outer scopes.
* **this binding** â†’ value of `this`.

---

## 2. Types of Execution Context

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**

   * Created when script starts.
   * Contains global objects (`window` in browser, `global` in Node.js).
   * Only one per program.

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**

   * Created when a function is called.
   * Each function has its own local variables, arguments, and scope.

3. **Eval Execution Context** (rarely used, discouraged).

---

## 3. Phases of Execution Context

Every EC goes through **two phases**:

### a) Creation Phase

* JS engine scans code.
* Memory is allocated for variables & functions.
* Variables declared with `var` â†’ initialized as `undefined`.
* Functions â†’ stored in memory fully.

### b) Execution Phase

* Code runs line by line.
* Variables assigned actual values.

---

### Example

```js
console.log(x); // undefined (hoisted)
var x = 10;

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
greet(); // Hello
```

âœ” During **Creation Phase**:

* `x` is hoisted â†’ `undefined`.
* `greet` is fully hoisted.

âœ” During **Execution Phase**:

* `x = 10`
* `greet()` runs.

---

## 4. Call Stack

* **Call Stack** = stack data structure to keep track of ECs.
* Global EC is at the bottom.
* Each function call â†’ new EC pushed on top.
* Function return â†’ EC popped.

### Example

```js
function a() {
  console.log("A");
  b();
}

function b() {
  console.log("B");
}

a();
console.log("Done");
```

Call Stack order:

1. GEC created.
2. `a()` pushed â†’ runs.
3. `b()` pushed â†’ runs.
4. `b()` popped.
5. `a()` popped.
6. GEC remains.

Output:

```
A
B
Done
```

---

## 5. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution

* **Synchronous** â†’ one task at a time (default in JS).
* **Asynchronous** â†’ tasks that wait (e.g., API calls, timers) donâ€™t block the main thread.

---

## 6. The Event Loop

Since JS is **single-threaded**, how does it handle async tasks?
ðŸ‘‰ With the **Event Loop**.

Components:

1. **Call Stack** â†’ runs functions.
2. **Web APIs** â†’ provided by browser (setTimeout, DOM events, fetch).
3. **Callback Queue (Task Queue)** â†’ holds completed async callbacks.
4. **Microtask Queue** â†’ holds promises/callbacks (`.then`, `catch`).
5. **Event Loop** â†’ checks if stack is empty â†’ pushes tasks from queues.

---

### Example with setTimeout

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout done");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

Flow:

1. "Start" logged.
2. `setTimeout` goes to Web API â†’ after 2s â†’ callback placed in Callback Queue.
3. "End" logged.
4. Event Loop checks â†’ pushes callback to Call Stack.
5. "Timeout done" logged.

Output:

```
Start
End
Timeout done
```

---

## 7. Microtasks vs Macrotasks

* **Macrotask Queue** â†’ setTimeout, setInterval, events.
* **Microtask Queue** â†’ promises, MutationObserver.

ðŸ‘‰ Microtasks have **higher priority** than macrotasks.

### Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

Output:

```
Start
End
Promise
setTimeout
```

âœ” Promise runs before setTimeout, even with 0ms delay.

---

## 8. Real-World Example (ClientPanel)

```js
console.log("Fetching clients...");

fetch("/api/clients")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log("Clients loaded:", data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

console.log("Continuing UI render...");
```

Flow:

1. "Fetching clients..." logged.
2. `fetch` sent to Web API.
3. "Continuing UI render..." logged.
4. Once response arrives â†’ `.then()` callback goes to **microtask queue**.
5. Event Loop pushes it when stack is free.

---

## 9. Key Takeaways

âœ” Execution Context = environment for running code.
âœ” Call Stack = keeps track of execution order.
âœ” JS is **single-threaded** but handles async with Event Loop.
âœ” **Microtasks (promises)** always run before **macrotasks (timeouts, events)**.
âœ” Event Loop ensures non-blocking, smooth execution â†’ vital for APIs, UI updates, SaaS apps.

---

## 10. Diagram (Mental Model)

```
[ Call Stack ]  <â€” Executes functions
[ Web APIs ]   <â€” Timers, fetch, DOM
[ Task Queue ] <â€” setTimeout, events
[ Microtasks ] <â€” promises
[ Event Loop ] <â€” Moves tasks when stack is empty
```

---

âœ… **Summary**

* Execution Context = how JS runs functions.
* Call Stack manages sync execution.
* Event Loop + Queues handle async tasks.
* Microtasks (Promises) > Macrotasks (Timers).
* This model powers modern apps â†’ from API fetching to real-time updates.
